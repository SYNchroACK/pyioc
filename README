pyioc is a set of tools to handle IOC files (openioc.org).

Some simple utilities for parsing IOC files:
iocdump.py: spit out the indicator items being referenced
iocwalk.py: parse the boolean logic behind the IOC and the items referenced.

pyiocClient: 
	A client for linux/windows that handles basic searches for Files, 
	processes, registry items and ports. It compiles to native linux/windows
	32 or 64bit code via pyinstaller and can therefore be run with no python
	interpreter on the client system. 
	
pyiocServer: 
	The server-side compliment to the client. It dishes out .ioc files to
	clients that call in via SOAP over SSL and logs the results of the
	client checks. 
	IOCs can be tailored by a simple directory structure corresponding to
	the net CIDR mask of the client system. 
	i.e. 
	iocs/172.21-16/firefox.ioc
	will issue the firefox.ioc to any system inthe 172.21.0.0/16 ip range
	when the client is run.
